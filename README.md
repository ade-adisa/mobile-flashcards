# mobile-flashcards

This is my iteration of the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. The Project here is a flashcard application, with ability to create new decks, set new questions and also test on these questions. The functionality to delete created decks as well is embedded.

## Installation

To use the application, you are to:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
